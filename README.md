## ðŸ“… Project Timeline

### ðŸ”¹ Week 1: C++ STL, Sorting & Searching
- Learn STL containers: `vector`, `map`, `set`, etc.
- Build a custom CP template (fast I/O, macros, etc.).
- Implement sorting algorithms (merge sort, quick sort, count sort).
- Analyze time and space complexity of sorting techniques.

### ðŸ”¹ Week 2: Greedy Algorithms & Bit Manipulation
- Solve classic greedy problems (activity selection, coin change).
- Understand failure cases of greedy algorithms.
- Practice bitwise operations: AND, OR, XOR, shifts.
- Apply bit tricks in optimization and state representation.

### ðŸ”¹ Week 3: Mathematics & Number Theory
- Implement modular arithmetic and fast exponentiation.
- Write the Sieve of Eratosthenes and its extensions.
- Practice combinatorics (factorials, nCr with mod).
- Learn probability basics used in CP.
- Understand and implement:
  - Eulerâ€™s Totient Function
  - Mobius Function

### ðŸ”¹ Week 4: Dynamic Programming
- Cover all 5 types: 1D, 2D, memoization, tabulation, DP on trees.
- Practice problem sets from Codeforces/AtCoder.
- Identify DP patterns like overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

### ðŸ”¹ Week 5: Graph Theory
- Learn graph representations: adjacency list and matrix.
- Practice DFS, BFS and their applications.
- Implement shortest path algorithms:
  - Dijkstra
  - Bellman-Ford
  - Floyd-Warshall
- Code MST algorithms:
  - Primâ€™s
  - Kruskalâ€™s
- Solve tree-specific problems (LCA, diameter, subtree size).

### ðŸ”¹ Week 6: String Algorithms
- Implement:
  - KMP Algorithm
  - Z Algorithm
- Build and use Trie for prefix-based problems.
- Learn suffix arrays and their applications in pattern matching and LCP.

### ðŸ”¹ Week 7: Segment Trees & Fenwick Trees
- Implement Segment Tree for:
  - Range queries
  - Point and range updates (with lazy propagation)
- Implement Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) for prefix sums.
- Solve problems involving cumulative frequency tables and range sums.
