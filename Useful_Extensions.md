## üñ•Ô∏è VS Code Extensions

1. **IntelliSense** (built-in)  
   - Offers context-aware code completions based on variable types, function signatures, and imported modules.

2. **Code Runner**  
   - **Why it‚Äôs useful:** Quickly runs code snippets directly from VS Code. If you encounter a `SIGSEGV` and Competitive Companion doesn‚Äôt show debug output, use Code Runner to execute your program in the integrated terminal. You can also specify compiler flags (e.g., `-std=c++20`) in its settings.

3. **GitHub Copilot**  
   - **Usage tips:**  
     - **Practice sessions:** Disable Copilot so you write everything yourself. Struggling through code builds speed, confidence, and debugging skills.  
     - **Contests:** Use Copilot only for boilerplate tasks like reading input or setting up data structures. Implement core logic manually, since Copilot‚Äôs suggestions can sometimes be misleading if taken without scrutiny.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Tips

- Most extensions offer a variety of settings. Explore and tweak them to match your workflow.  
- For example, Code Runner might default to an older compiler version (causing errors with modern C++ features). Adjust its settings to use the latest compiler to avoid lambda or C++20 issues.
